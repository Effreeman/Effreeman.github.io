I am a girl who loves anything outdoors and geeks out about anything technology related. Most girls get butterflies and all excited when they meet a cute guy, well I get like that when I’m introduced to new technology. I like the discovery, the exploration of understanding how technology works.  My love for technology goes way back but it didn’t become evident to me until the end of my freshman year of college. I started out on the pre-med track and was shadowing a neurosurgeon and quickly realized I was way more interested in the technology he was using. He created these advanced robots that he has stationed in remote villages in Bolivia to give back to where he is originally from. He controls these robots from his office in Canada and is able to help the doctors provide better care. I became fascinated with it all and that is when I really found my love for technology. While at school I ended up being part of a few startups, with my favorite being one that involved health. I ended up switch into the engineering school to pursue the medical device start up. After graduating I decided I wanted to go to chiropractic school where I soon realized the healthcare field was not for which Is why I ended up deciding to stop pursuing chiropractic and start pursuing a career in tech. The fact that I love technology and medicine made it very confusing to make a decision on what I really wanted to do. I don’t think the year and a half of chiropractic school I attended was a setback in any way. I am hoping to do software development for medical devices and since I have an extensive knowledge in the central nervous system it makes me a great fit for a position in that area.
